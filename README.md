# This code compares reef framework budgets and reef sediment budgets 
# as well as benthic community composition and sediment composition for reefs 
# around islands with high and low sebird densities in the Chagos Archipelago, BIOT.
# Data were collected on lagoonal reefs (1-2m), shallow forereefs (2-3m) and deep forereefs (8-9m)   
# in Apr/May 2021 (Sediment samples) and Oct/Nov 2023 (Sediment samples, ReefBudget surveys, SedBudget surveys)
